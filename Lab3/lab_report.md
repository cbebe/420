# Description of Implementation

### Methods of Parallelization

### Testing Different Scheduling Schemes

In order to determine which scheduling schemes allowed for the most optimized results, we created nine different schemes for every possible combination of scheduling policies for the Gaussian and Jordan elimination algorithms. For example, `schemeds.c` executes the Gaussian elimination algorithm using dynamic scheduling and the Jordan elimination algorithm using static scheduling. By testing different combinations of scheduling policies, we were able to find that using a scheduling scheme of <> for Gaussian elimination and <> for Jordan elimination gave us the fastest run time.
