main1: Single mutex protecting the entire array (Scheme 1)
main2: Multiple mutexes protecting separate strings in the array (Scheme 2)
main3: Single read-write lock protecting the entire array (Scheme 3)
main4: Multiple read-write locks protecting separate strings in the array (Scheme 4)

Notes:

- The implementation of the functionality given in `common.h` has been
  transferred to `common.c` to let us link the functions to the executables after
  compilation. We would otherwise get duplicate definitions.

- `saveTimes` has been modified to take in a filename so that we can save the
  performance records of each server separately. The main executables pass in a
  filename in this format:

  `output-scheme<SCHEME_NUMBER>-<ARRAY_SIZE>`

  The server also deletes this file if it exists on startup so previous tests
  would not pollute the current test data.
