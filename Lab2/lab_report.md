# Description of Implementation

# Performance Discussion

| n    | Scheme 1     | Scheme 2     | Scheme 3     | Scheme 4     |
| ---- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| 10   | 9.365774e-03 | 2.077372e-04 | 4.095920e-03 | 1.785272e-04 |
| 100  | 9.379739e-03 | 1.538090e-04 | 4.108292e-03 | 1.517450e-04 |

Processing times of different data protection schemes averaged over 100 runs (in seconds)

Our fastest access time was with scheme 4 N=1000 which was 1.379058e-04 seconds  
A close second was scheme 2 N=1000 with 1.379330e-04 seconds
